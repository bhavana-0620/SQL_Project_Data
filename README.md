## 📊 Data Model Overview  

The dataset follows a **star-schema-like structure**:

- `job_postings_fact` → Main fact table  
- `company_dim` → Company details  
- `skills_dim` → Skill definitions  
- `skills_job_dim` → Bridge table (job ↔ skills)

### 🔹 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs  

To accurately identify top-paying roles:

- Filtered only **true Data Analyst roles**  
- Excluded senior roles (Director, Manager, Principal)  
- Focused on roles with **valid salary data**  
- Used **window functions (ROW_NUMBER)** for ranking  

#### ✅ Key Insight  

- The highest-paying jobs for data analysts that allow remote work offer a wide range of salaries, the highest at $650,000!
- Salaries vary significantly, indicating **wide compensation bands**  
- High-paying roles often include **hybrid skill expectations**  
- Some job titles include advanced responsibilities beyond traditional analysis  

---

### 🔹 2. Skills Required for Top-Paying Jobs  

- Identified top 10 highest-paying roles  
- Joined with skill data to extract required skills  

#### ✅ Key Insight  

- High-paying roles require **multi-skill combinations**  
- SQL is a baseline skill, while **Python and cloud tools** increase salary potential  
- Advanced roles combine **analysis + data engineering capabilities**

---

### 🔹 3. Most In-Demand Skills  

- Calculated demand using **percentage of job postings**  
- Filtered only relevant Data Analyst roles  

#### ✅ Key Insight  

- SQL is a **baseline requirement**, not a differentiator  
- Excel remains highly relevant for business analysis  
- Visualization tools are consistently in demand  

---

### 🔹 4. Skills Based on Salary  

- Calculated average salary per skill  
- Filtered low-frequency skills to avoid bias  

#### ✅ Key Insight  

- Some skills have **high salary but low demand** → niche skills  
- Cloud and big data tools command higher salaries  
- Cross-functional skills increase earning potential  

---

### 🔹 5. Optimal Skills (Demand + Salary)  

- Combined demand and salary metrics  
- Focused on reliable, high-frequency skills  

#### ✅ Key Insight  

- Optimal skills lie at the intersection of:
  - High demand  
  - High salary  

- Best strategy:
  👉 Focus on **balanced skill development**
